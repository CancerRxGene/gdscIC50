Description: Fits dose response curves for data from the Genomics of Drug 
             Sensitivity of Cancer (GDSC). The gdscIC50 package wrangles GDSC raw 
             data before fitting sigmoidal dose reponse curves using a non-linear
             mixed effects model. IC50 values and estimated along with the area 
             under the curve (AUC). The curve fitting code is based on that originally
             available as https://github.com/NKI-CCB/MixedIC50. The method is 
             published in Vis, D.J. et al. Pharmacogenomics 2016, 17(7):691-700
